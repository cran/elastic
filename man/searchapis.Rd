Search functions.
}
\details{
Elasticsearch search APIs include the following functions:
\itemize{
 \item \code{\link{Search}} - Search using the Query DSL via the body of the request.
 \item \code{\link{Search_uri}} - Search using the URI search API only. This may be
 needed for servers that block POST requests for security, or maybe you don't need
 complicated requests, in which case URI only requests are suffice.
 \item \code{\link{search_shards}} - Search shards.
 \item \code{\link{mlt}} - More like this queries.
 \item \code{\link{count}} - Get counts for various searches.
 \item \code{\link{explain}} - Computes a score explanation for a query and a specific
 document. This can give useful feedback whether a document matches or didn't match
 a specific query.
}

More will be added soon.
