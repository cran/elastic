elastic 0.3.0
===============

First version to go to CRAN.

NEW FEATURES

* Added a function `scroll()` and a `scroll` parameter to the `Search()` function (#36)
* Added the function `explain()` to easily get at explanation of search results.
* Added a help file added to help explain timem and distance units. See `?units-time` and 
`?units=distance`
* New help file added to list and explain the various search functions. See `?searchapis`
* New function `tokenizer_set()` to set tokenizers
* `connect()` run on package load to set default base url of `localhost` and port of `9200` - 
you can override this by running that fxn yourself, or storing `es_base`, `es_port`, etc. 
in your `.Rprofile` file.

IMPROVEMENTS

* Made CouchDB river plugin functions not exported for now, may bring back later. 
* Added vignettes for an intro and for search details and examples (#2)
* `es_search()` changed to `Search()`.
* More datasets included in the package for bulk data load (#16)
* All examples wrapped in `\dontrun` instead of `\donttest` so they don't fail on CRAN checks.
* `es_search_body()` removed - body based queries using the query DSL moved to the `Search()` 
function, passed into the `body` parameter.

elastic 0.2.0
===============

IMPROVEMENTS

* Remoworked package API. Almost all functions have new names. Sorry for this major change
but it needed to be done. This brings `elastic` more in line with the official Elasticsearch
Python client (http://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.org/en/master/).
* Similar functions are grouped together in the same manual file now to make finder related
functions easier. For example, all functions that work with indices are on the `index` manual
page, and all functions prefixed with `index_()`. Thematic manual files are: `index`, `cat`,
`cluster`, `alias`, `cdbriver`, `connect`, `documents`, `mapping`, `nodes`, and `search`.
* Note that the function `es_cat()` was changed to `cat_()` - we avoided `cat()` because as 
you know there is already a widely used function in base R, see `base::cat()`.
* We changed `cat` functions to separate functions for each command, instead of passing 
the command in as an argument. For example, `cat('aliases')` becomes `cat_aliases()`.
* The `es_` prefix remains only for `es_search()`, as we have to avoid conflict with 
`base::search()`. 
* Removed `assertthat` package import, using `stopifnot()` instead (#14)
